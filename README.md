# Community Version of Slate ü§ù

This is a community version of Slate which was forked from the original, and is no longer associated with or related to [Shopify.](https://www.shopify.com/)

**Slate _was_** an open-source project built for the Shopify Theme community, and with contributions from the community this take-off can be very successful too!

This branch remains open source, and it's open source license can be [found here.](https://github.com/CocoaWebStudio/slate/blob/master/LICENSE)

- Multiple bug corrections üë¢ üêõ üí•

_With other new features to be announced..._ üéâ

### Not ready for NPM publication yet, but soon üëç

This repo is a [monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md) consisting of multiple packages and is managed using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

While this is a community fork of an open source project, however due to the number of times [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is mentioned we have not been able to get approval from NPM to publish this package yet.

We are continually working on this issue, and are hoping to have full NPM support in the near future.

Until then _please follow_ the steps below in order to get the project running on your local machine. ‚¨á

### Getting Started Locally üöÄ

In order to use this project along with your own Slate project, you need to install both projects into one directory.

It should look like this:

```
parentDirectory/
   yourSlateProject/
   slate/
```

You also need to modify the dev dependencies in the `package.json` file of `./yourSlateProject` just like the following:

```json
...
"devDependencies": {
  "@shopify/slate-tools": "file:../slate/packages/slate-tools",
...
```
